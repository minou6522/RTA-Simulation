# Thin Film Optics Computations

This repository contains a set of high-level programming language scripts for performing computations related to thin film optics. Thin film optics is the study of the behavior of light when it interacts with thin layers of material. This includes phenomena such as interference, reflection, and transmission of light waves through thin films.

## Introduction

Thin films are layers of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness. They are used in various applications, including coatings for lenses and mirrors, semiconductor devices, and reflective surfaces. Understanding the optical properties of thin films is crucial for designing and optimizing these applications.

This project provides tools to compute essential optical properties of thin films, including:

- Reflectance
- Transmittance
- Absorptance
- Phase changes upon reflection and transmission

## Features

- **Reflectance and Transmittance Calculations**: Compute the reflectance and transmittance of thin films for different wavelengths and angles of incidence.
- **Multilayer Structures**: Handle computations for single and multilayer thin film structures.
- **Material Properties**: Use refractive indices for various materials, including dispersion (wavelength-dependent refractive index).
- **Graphical Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the optical properties as a function of wavelength or angle.
